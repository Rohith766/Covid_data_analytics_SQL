# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the README file for the COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data obtained from Our World in Data and provide insights regarding the percentage of deaths worldwide, the percentage of the population infected, total deaths per continent, and the death count based on countries. The analysis is presented in an interactive dashboard created using Tableau, and a website has been developed to access the dashboard.

## Dataset
The COVID-19 data used for this project was obtained from Our World in Data. The dataset provides information about COVID-19 cases and deaths globally. You can access the dataset from the following link:
[Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## Pre-processing
SQL was used for the pre-processing of the COVID-19 data. The data was cleaned, transformed, and aggregated to create meaningful insights for analysis. The pre-processed data was then used for visualization in Tableau.

## Visualization
Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard to visualize the COVID-19 data. The dashboard provides insights on the percentage of deaths worldwide, the percentage of the population infected, total deaths per continent, and the death count based on countries. The visualizations aim to present the data in an intuitive and informative way, allowing users to explore and interact with the data.

## Accessing the Dashboard
To access the interactive dashboard, a website has been developed. You can access the website and explore the COVID-19 EDA dashboard through the following link:

## Instructions
To run and use the code for this project, please follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the necessary dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the project documentation.
3. Run the SQL scripts provided in the project to preprocess the COVID-19 data.
4. Open the Tableau workbook to access and interact with the COVID-19 EDA dashboard.
5. Deploy the website containing the dashboard on a web server to make it accessible to users.
